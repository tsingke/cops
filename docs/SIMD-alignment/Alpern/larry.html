Dr. Carter recently accepted a joint appointment as
a professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the
University of California at San Diego and a Senior Fellow at the San
Diego Supercomputing Center. Prior to that, he had worked at IBM's Watson
Research Center for almost 20 years, taking sabbatical leaves to UC
Berkeley, Penn State University, the University of Colorado. His
research interests are remarkably similar to Dr. Alpern's, and they
are frequent collaborators.  <p>
