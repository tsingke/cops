<h1>Altivec accelerations</h1>
<p>The main reason I use Altivec is to improve the performance of our Molecular Dynamics package <a href="http://www.gromacs.org/">Gromacs</a>
 on Apple computers. I've had great help from Apple in doing this, and 
Gromacs is now Altivec-accelerated by default on any platform that 
supports it. Molecular Dynamics is however by definition very hard to 
vectorize, so just for fun I wanted to try optimizing an easier 
application.</p>

<h1>HMMer</h1>
<p>Hidden Markov Models provide a more sensitive way of searching 
databases compared to simple algorithms like BLAST. Unfortunately they 
are also much slower, but BLAST cannot detect most distant similarities.
 The most commonly used program for HMM searches is <a href="http://csb.stanford.edu/%7Elindahl/altivec/hmmer.wustl.edu">HMMer</a>
 by Sean Eddy, and since it is distributed under the GNU General Public 
License I decided to have a go at rewriting the core routines in 
Altivec.</p>
Actually, things went way better than I could ever imagine. After 2-3 
days of work the hmmsearch program was almost 9 times faster compared to
 the non-altivec version, and 6-7 times faster than x86 versions. (Here 
are some benchmarks for <a href="http://csb.stanford.edu/%7Elindahl/altivec/hmmsearch.pdf">hmmsearch</a> and <a href="http://csb.stanford.edu/%7Elindahl/altivec/hmmpfam.pdf">hmmpfam</a>).
 I've contributed these routines back to Sean Eddy, and they will appear
 as an optional configuration parameter in the next released version of 
HMMer.<p></p>
<br>
<br>
Until then, you can get the source tarball here:
<a href="http://csb.stanford.edu/%7Elindahl/altivec/hmmer-2.2g-altivec.tar.gz">hmmer-2.2g-altivec.tar.gz</a>
<br>
If you are having problems downloading it, make sure you don't use a web
 browser (e.g. netscape) that uncompresses the file on the fly. If you 
do, you might have to ask your local system guru for help...
<br><br>
Please note that neither I or Sean can provide support, but the changes 
are very minor, so it should not be more complicated to install than the
 normal non-altivec version. Normally you should only have to open a 
terminal (locate the file) and type:
<pre>$&gt; tar -xzvf hmmer-2.2g-altivec.tar.gz

$&gt; cd hmmer-2.2g-altivec

$&gt; ./configure

$&gt; make

</pre>

That's it. The binaries should be present in hmmer-2.2g-altivec/binaries. Consult the <a href="http://csb.stanford.edu/%7Elindahl/altivec/hmmer.wustl.edu">HMM website</a> for more information!
