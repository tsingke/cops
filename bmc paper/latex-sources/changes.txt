1. It seems like something has happened to almost all references to figures, as
the text just reads "(section )" instead of referring to an actual figure number, or
the figure number is just missing (bottom of page 8). I therefore had to put in the
figure numbers myself. This needs to be fixed.

Fixed. We changed the paper template and now the captions work.

2. The authors should state the type of software license that applies to their code.
Also, the manuscript should state that the source code is available, not just
include an URL in the abstract.

Fixed. It is essentially the ISC, except that this paper must be cited in published media.

3. On page 2, the word "mutations" on line 5 below the subheading "Sequence
Alignment Algorithms" should be replaced with "substitutions".

fixed

 On line 12 in the
same section the fragment "... in which each vector contains cells from the same
column distancing some fixed K from each other" should be rephrased.

fixed. thanks.

 On line
17 in the same section the word "using" in the phrase "... Rognes' method makes
use of using vector processing ..." should be deleted.

fixed.

4. On page 3, the authors cite "Krogh and Haussler [8]" but the cited work
actually has five authors and should be cited as "Krogh et al. [8]".

Fixed. Miguel faz check, ha muitas refs tipo Krogh-Haussler model, tens a certeza disso ?

5. On page 6, line 2 from the bottom, it is stated that "The theoretical estimates
suggested a critical point of full L1D utilization when using models of size ~1470
for ViterbiFilter and ~167 for ViterbiStream ...", while in table 1 the corresponding
values are 1350 and 167. What is the reason for this discrepancy?

Miguel, de facto isto e estranho, pensava que era experimental, mas parece que tanto o texto como a tabela sao teoria ????

6. The overall structure of the manuscript is fine, but in general the language of
the manuscript could be improved somewhat and the descriptions could be made
clearer and more precise.

7. The detailed description of the approach needs improvement. In particular, the
authors should explain their notation and the meaning of all the variables used
(e.g. Mnext, V, I, J, eIj, xi, aIjIj. qxi, vE, Dcv). This applies to some of the text as
well as the equations on page 3 and listings 1 and 2. Also, the meaning of all
states in the HMM (not just M, D and I) should be explained.

Now there is a longer explanation about the state of the HMM. Now there is a brief explanation about the variables, just afther the equation.

8. It is hard to keep track of all the loop levels (inner, outer, middle) in the
description of the code. Perhaps this could be made clearer by naming the loops
in some manner.

sugiro ser o Miguel a fazer isto. Nuno ??

9. COPS is evaluated using Dfam, a database of HMMs of repetitive DNA. Were
all Dfam entries used or just a selection? In the latter case, the entries need to be
given and an explanation for the selection should be included.

10. It would be interesting to know if the software also works with protein HMMs
and if the performance using a database of protein family HMMs (e.g. Pfam)
would be different.

todo Miguel   

11. To improve reproducibility of the evaluation, all details regarding the
benchmarking should be included in the text or on the website: the version of the
COPS code, the actual code, command line options, scripts, databases (version,
date) and genome sequences.

todo Miguel  

12. At the end of the Conclusion the authors briefly mention that the partitioning
scheme used in COPS perhaps could be applied to Farrar's striped approach as
well. Since the performance of COPS relative to HMMer is highly dependent on
the model length, it seems like the reason for most of the performance
improvement in COPS is due to better cache efficiency and not due to the use of
inter-task vs intra-task parallelization. The authors could perhaps elaborate a bit
on this and the importance of the different factors involved in the performance
improvement.

We added a longer paragraph, arguing that our improvement is mostly related to the size of
the HMM, not the particular way in wich state probabilities are computed.

Rev 1

The introduction highlights the drawback of Rognes implementation. But the
paper is based on the Rognes strategy. Things should be presented differently
(?)

In fact this was mostly an excessively critical explanation. The
approach from Rognes is currently the fastest approach. We rewrote the
before last paragragph of the background.
